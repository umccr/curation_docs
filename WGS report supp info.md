## Clinical Significance of Variants Based on AMP / ASCO / CAP Guidelines
Adapted from [PMID: 27993330](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993330/)
### Strong Significance
#### Tier 1A
- Biomarker predicts response or resistance to an FDA or EMA approved therapy, according to drug label or professional guidelines for this diagnosis
- Biomarker included in professional guidelines is prognostic or diagnostic for this diagnosis

#### Tier 1B	
- Biomarker predicts response or resistance to a therapy for this diagnosis based on well powered studies
- Biomarker is prognostic or diagnostic for this diagnosis based on well-powered studies

### Potential Significance
#### Tier 2C
- Biomarker is associated with response or resistance to an FDA or EMA approved therapy, according to drug label or professional guidelines but only for different diagnosis
- Biomarker is an inclusion criterion for an active clinical trial
- Biomarker is prognostic or diagnostic based on multiple small studies

#### Tier 2D
- Biomarker shows plausible response or resistance based on case or preclinical studies
- Biomarker may assist in disease diagnosis or prognosis based on small studies

### Uncertain Significance
#### Tier 3
- Biomarker has uncertain clinical significance and not known to be likely benign or benign
